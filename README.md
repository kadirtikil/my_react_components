# My React Components

This repo just contains any components I build and use on the regular. Doesn't contain anything fancy. In most cases I find what i need from libraries like Material UI. Use as you please.

# TScramble
Makes the scramble text effect for react in TypeScript. Just create a ref using the useRef hook and place it into a **div**.
Then create a new TScramble object in the use effect and pass in the ref, and the text you want the scramble effect on. 
Then use the method run() and pass in a boolean (only metric for now) to decide if you want lower or uppercase characters in your scramble.
DONE. 
Code is straight forward.
